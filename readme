Abbe Says is a small site in which I'm planning to keep track of the fun quotes that Albert (Abbe) and my other sons Gustav and Arvid eventually will drop. 

I will for now not build the possiblity to register but build the datamodel so that it will hold for more parents.

Here's my backlog
- View all qoutes
- View quotes per kid
- View quote details
- Like (via Facebook)
- Comment on qoute
- Log in via Basic Authentication
- Create new kid
- Create new quote
- Update quote details
- Update kid details
- Create new account
